## Description

This is a NestJS server for an E-Commerce application. It provides a RESTful API for managing products and uploading product images. The server uses PostgreSQL as the database and TypeORM for database operations.

### Features

- PostgreSQL database integration with TypeORM
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Image upload functionality
- Static file serving for uploaded images
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

## Project setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content (or copy from `.env.example`):

```
# Database Configuration
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_DATABASE=my_local_market_db
DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true
```

3. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## API Endpoints

### Products

- `GET /products` - Get all products
- `GET /products/:id` - Get a product by ID
- `POST /products` - Create a new product
- `PUT /products/:id` - Update a product
- `DELETE /products/:id` - Delete a product

### Images

- `POST /images/upload/:productId` - Upload an image for a product
- `GET /images/product/:productId` - Get all images for a product
- `GET /images/:id` - Get an image by ID
- `DELETE /images/:id` - Delete an image

## Example Usage

### Creating a product

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sample Product",
    "description": "This is a sample product",
    "price": 19.99,
    "stock": 100
  }'
```

### Uploading an image for a product

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/images/upload/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"
```

## Run tests

# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```
